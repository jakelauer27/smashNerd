### Background / About

Currently there is not an all-in-one site for getting information about all of the Smash Brothers characters and stages. In order to find everything a user may want to know they have to traverse at least 5 sites, until now! SmashNerd provides Character cards and Stage cards, but also the ability to search and filter based on original game franchise, universe, pro-ranking, and much more.

SmashNerd provides the following robust information - 
#### Characters: 
    - Condensed pros and cons for each
    - Moveset and general information
    - Speed, weight, and jump stats 
    - Performance and rankings in the pro circuit
    - Character comparison chart
#### Stages:
    - General information
    - Platform availability
#### Overall:
    - An intuitive and eloquent UI with vibrant character and stage images
    - 200 compressed svgs, images, and icons for every character, stage, and universe and 
    - Link to even more information
    
### User Stories

#### Landing Page
 - As a user, when I arrive to the landing page, I will see a "continue to site" button. When I click on that button, I will be taken to the characters page.

#### Characters Page:
 - As a user, I can see all 58 characters' icons and names in alphabetical order. In order to
view more info about each character, I can click on each card. By clicking on a card, the
card enlarges and rotates, showing me the information about each character.

 - If I want to scroll through each card while a card is enlarged, I can click on arrows
to the right or left of the card. To exit the individual card, I can click an X by the card. I see the card close or minimize
back to normal size.

#### Stages Page:
 - As a user, when I view the stages page, I see the name and icon for every stage
in alphabetical order on the page.

 - When I click on a card, I see the card enlarge and reveal additional information
about the repective stage. 

 - If I want to scroll through each card while a card is enlarged, I can click on arrows
to the right or left of the card. To exit the individual card, I can click an X by the card. I see the card close or minimize
back to normal size.

#### Compare Page:
 - As a user, when I click on the link for the compare page, I should be taken
to a new page where I see a grid of stats for each player.

 - The row headers are the names of each character. The column headers contain the following:
  *tier
  *rank
  *wins/losses
  *weight class
  *weight value
  *jump height
  *run speed
  *dash speed
  *air speed
  *fall speed
  *fast fall speed
  *Each cell in the table will contain the particular statistic for the character.

-As a user, if I click on a column header, the characters will be sorted from
best to worst of that specific statistic.
